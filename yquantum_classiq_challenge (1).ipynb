        "## Classiq's YQuantum 2024 Sparse State-Preparation Challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Sparse State-Preparation Challenge, presented by Classiq at YQuantum 2024. This challenge is designed for quantum computing enthusiasts of all levels, aiming to enhance your understanding and spur innovation in sparse state-preparation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenge Overview\n",
        "- **Objective**: Develop quantum circuits that efficiently prepare sparse quantum states. These states are characterized by a small number of non-zero amplitudes, reducing quantum resource requirements and enhancing practical execution on near-term quantum hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "- **Importance of State Preparation**: State preparation is a crucial first step for many quantum algorithms. It involves setting a quantum state to represent a specific vector of probabilities or functions. The challenge focuses on sparse states, which are pivotal in applications like quantum linear algebra and quantum machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Statement\n",
        "- **Sparse State-Preparation**: Your task is to create circuits that load a quantum state with probabilities corresponding to a given sparse vector. This challenge highlights the nuances of designing circuits that are both efficient and effective for today's quantum computing limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resources and Guidance\n",
        "- **Classiq's Tools**: Utilize Classiq’s platform, QMOD language, and SDK, which provide robust tools for designing and testing quantum algorithms. Participants are encouraged to base their implementations on \"An Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Quantum State Preparation\" by Niels Gleinig and Torsten Hoefler.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goals and Expectations\n",
        "- **Output Goal**: Efficiently prepare a quantum state reflecting specified probabilities, ensuring high fidelity and resource efficiency.\n",
        "- **Example**: For input `{‘00000001’: 0.25, ‘00010001’: 0.5, ‘11001000’: 0.25}`, the output quantum state should correspond to these probabilities.\n"

        "- **Functionality**:\n",
        "  - It initializes the quantum environment with the necessary number of qubits based on the input state descriptions.\n",
        "  - The sparse states are first converted into a format suitable for quantum operations using `dict_to_3d_array`.\n",
        "  - The main function then invokes `algorithm_1` to find the necessary operation to prepare the sparse quantum state.\n",
        "  - After `algorithm_1` completes, the `main` function applies the quantum operations to finalize the state preparation.\n",
        "  - It is responsible for managing and applying the computed operations to the quantum system, effectively translating the classical pre-processing results into quantum manipulations."
